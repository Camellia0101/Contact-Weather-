# ContactWeather
In this project, I've used updated technologies such as `RecyclerView`, `Retrofit`, `Room`, `GoogleMap`, `etc`.
To clarify the project's functionality, a user can select some contacts from his device to observe their weather status based on their location.
Furthermore, I used `OpenWeatherMap` APIs to access weather data for any location.
